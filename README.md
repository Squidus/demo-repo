---About Me---
I am an electrical engineering student who likes learning and challenging himself. I enjoy video games, hiking, and camping. I grew up on a cattle ranch and have spent most of my life thus far troubleshooting equipment and animals. This has lead to an intense enjoyment of applying troubleshooting skills to programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems, and other miscellaneous systems. I just find solving problems to be the ultimate satisfaction no matter the medium I encounter them in.
